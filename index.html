            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="lead">It has been observed that women consistently earn lower than men, across occupations, across
              education levels,
              across countries. The Wage Gap is defined as systemic and institutionalized differences in earnings
              between
              men and women. In 2020, women earned 84% of what men earned, according to a Pew Research Center analysis
              of median hourly earnings of both full- and part-time workers. Based on this estimate, it would take an
              extra
              42
              days of work for women to earn what men did in 2020.</p>
            <p class="lead">
              This effect is especially exacerbated in women of color. This is closely linked to the history of labor in
              America. Discrimination has historically been ingrained in the U.S., from depriving wages to Black women
              or
              stealing land and opportunity from Native women. There are lasting consequences to this history of
              oppression.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              At the current rate of progress, the gender pay gap will not close until 2111. So why does the gender gap
              still persist? Much of the gap is driven by factors such as educational attainment, occupational
              segregation
              and work experience. Women as a whole are over-represented in lower-paying occupations, and
              underrepresented
              in high-paying ones, relative to their share of the workforce. While discrimination on the basis of sex
              has
              been prohibited, it still plays a role in the wage discrepancies.

            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Below, we will explore these disparities in income nationally and globally in order to better visualize
              patterns in gender wage gaps.

          <p class="lead">US Bureau of Labor Statistics released weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers by
            sex, last modified in 2021. The graph below depicts the constant dollar trends of earnings over time. While
            both genders have experienced growth in wages over time, the gap between male and female salaries persists
            from 2012 to 2021. This effect has been driven by historical factors including occupational segregation,
            gender based discrimination, and access to medical and family leave.

          <p class="lead">This graph shows the weekly wage difference between men and women by occupation. It's
            important to note that regardless of occupation, there is always a gap. This is true even for occupations
            that are predominantly done by women. If we ignore age differences, experience, etc., and only compare men
            and women with the same jobs and qualifications, women make 98% of what men make. This is a brilliant
            illustration of how numerous factors are currently contributing to the wage gap, such as the fact that fewer
            women major in STEM fields. These differences often come from different stereotypes and pressures that are
            placed on women vs. men.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Income Inequality By Education and Gender</h2>
          <p class="lead"> This graph depicts the income gap based on different educational backgrounds between men and
            women. On average, women are more likely to have a bachelor's degree among full-time workers, with 41.7% of
            women having one and 36.2% of men. With 18 million women obtaining this type of degree and 21 million men,
            this suggests that it is easier for men to get jobs that may be a stretch based on their qualifications,
            potentially contributing further to income inequality. Additionally, working women who haven't attained a
            college education tend to be older than their male counterparts, and for those who have attained a
            bachelor's, the men tend to be younger. These trends mean that the wage gap is slightly smaller among those
            without a bachelor's degree, since women tend to have more years of experience. However, the gap is still
            present.

          <p class="lead">This graph depicts the number of women who are CEOs in the Fortune 500. In the past 25 years,
            the number of women CEO's has been steadily increasing, with the highest number being 6.4% in 2017, at least
            in our data set. Currently, there are 41 women CEOs, accounting for 8.2%. Some of this change has been from
            new companies making the rankings, while several have been from companies falling off the list due to
            decreasing revenues. Amidst this issue some companies, such as Nasdaq, have been looking into diversity
            mandates to encourage women and minorities to have higher positions in these companies. Some CEOs, like the
            CEO of Xerox from 2009-2016 Usrula Burns, originally opposed these mandates, but have mentioned that they
            might support them if companies don't start to change on their own.</p>

          <p class="lead">The graph below shows the change in percentage of university presidents who are women from
            1986 to 2016. In 2016, 30.1% of university presidents were women, which is triple the percentage from 1986.
            Frances Elizabeth Willard became the first female college president in 1871, heading the Evanston College
            for Ladies in Illinois, which later merged with Northwestern University. In 1975, Lorene L. Rogers was the
            first woman to lead a major research university (University of Texas), and Judith Rodin in 1994 became the
            first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution (University of Pennsylvania). Despite these
            major accomplishments, there is still an uneven distribution of female presidents in American universities.
            Why are there so few women leading universities? A number of variables account for this lack of women in
            leadership roles, including lack of diversity in hiring practices, bias, and family life.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            The gender wage gap is a persistent and systemic issue that affects women of all demographics and
            occupations. Efforts to close the wage gap must address the varying drivers of it as well as the multitude
            of biases that hold women—particularly women of color, LGBTQ women, and women with other diverse
            identities—and their families back. Looking forward, we must invest in equal pay reform to combat
            discriminatory practices in the workplace. For example, access to paid sick days and a comprehensive paid
            family and medical leave program are essential policies that would help minimize job loss and ensure better
            economic security for all workers. Beyond public policy, society must confront cultural biases that continue
            to harm women by devaluing their work and confining them to specific gender roles. This is an issue of
            economic security and equality—and women and their families cannot afford to wait for either.
